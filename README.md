# MyShell

Designed my own shell that has an interactive mode which provides immediate and active feedback and a batch mode where a script/file with a set of commands is provided as the argument.
The shell has the ability to read and parse user input, perform a fork() system call to create a new concurrent child process, and execute any given commands.
Included essential built in commands of a shell including cd (change directory), exit, and help command.
